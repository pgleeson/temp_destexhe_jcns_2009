NEURON simulations of self-sustained AI states in a small N=500
network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, described by
Adaptative Exponential (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) type neurons
with exponential approach to threshold.  The connectivity is random
and there is a small proportion (5%) of LTS cells among the
excitatory neurons.  See details in the following article:
